                        <li>Implementing communication between two or more hosts with <strong>sliding window protocol</strong> that uses <strong>selective repeat/retransmission</strong> and <strong>cumulative ACK</strong> to ensure the <strong>reliable in-order</strong> delivery of frames between hosts since frames sent on the network links can and will be corrupted in flight. (window size =8 on both ends)</li>
                        <li>Sender hosts must transmit messages typed in at the command line to a corresponding receiver host.</li>
                        <li>Receivers need to reassemble frames, retrieve the correct message that the sender had sent, and output it.</li>
                        <li>Divide the messages which are larger than MAX_FRAME_SIZE (i.e. 64 bytes) into frames.</li>
                        <li>Implement <strong>Error Detection Mechanism</strong> which is <strong>CRC-8</strong> on senders and receivers.</li>

Moreover, use <strong>Adapter Pattern</strong> to make an <strong>adapter</strong> so that we can handle both String and const char* in only one function when we try to implement those operations.</li>
                        <li>Create a useful method in <strong>Searchable</strong> to implement the <strong>find()</strong> method(operation), which will allow a user to search within the given string for a character, or sub-string.</li>
